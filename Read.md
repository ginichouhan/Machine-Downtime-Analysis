# Machine Downtime Analysis 🚧📊

A data analysis project focused on identifying, visualizing, and reducing **unplanned machine downtime** using real-world industrial data.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze machine downtime patterns and help minimize **unplanned machine downtime**, which leads to **loss of productivity** and increased **maintenance costs**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> "Machines used in pump manufacturing are facing unplanned downtime, directly impacting production output and efficiency."

---

## 🧭 Methodology – CRISP-ML(Q)

1. Business Understanding  
2. Data Understanding  
3. Data Preparation  
4. Modeling (Optional for prediction)  
5. Evaluation  
6. Deployment & Quality Feedback

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **MySQL**
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PowerPoint for presentation**
- **Excel (for initial EDA)**

---

## 📂 Data Description

- **Records**: 2500  
- **Features**: 16  
- **Missing Values**: 152  
- **Duplicate Rows**: 0  

Dataset includes:
- Timestamps
- Downtime reasons
- Machine types
- Maintenance logs

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Time series plot to identify trends
- Distribution plots (histograms, boxplots)
- Correlation heatmap
- Group-wise analysis of downtime by machine type

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Imported data into MySQL from CSV
- Handled missing values using mean imputation
- Treated outliers beyond 2 standard deviations
- Prepared clean dataset for visualization

---

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Certain machines showed repetitive unplanned downtime
- Downtime peaks identified on specific time intervals
- Strong correlation found between maintenance delays and unplanned stops

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Implement **Predictive Maintenance**
- Track machine-specific performance weekly
- Automate alerts for early detection of recurring issues
